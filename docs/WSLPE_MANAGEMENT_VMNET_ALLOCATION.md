# WSLPE management vmnet3 candidate allocation preflight

**Status: READ-ONLY source plan. Not a host installation.** The source tests and current operator evidence show that the management network `172.28.232.0/24` is a nonoverlapping candidate, `vmnet3` is unallocated and five NORTH VMware machines are running. This means configuring VMware networks **now** would violate the project's live-VM networking stop gate.

## Facts retained

- Existing WSLPE exercise network: `vmnet2`, `172.28.231.0/24`.
- Proposed **operator-only** management network: `vmnet3`, `172.28.232.0/24`, Kali host `172.28.232.254`, future disposable Windows NIC `.31`, no DHCP, no NAT.
- NORTH VMware networks vmnet10/20/30/99, WSLPE vmnet2 and the global NAT vmnet8 must not change.
- Existing three-port WSLPE host firewall remains installed in memory, not reboot-persistent; retain it until the guest's port forwards have actually been removed and verified.
- Existing registered WSLPE golden/master and learner-test VM must never be adopted by this experiment.

## Candidate planner usage

After pulling this code into the existing development checkout, the read-only command is:

```bash
cd "$HOME/kingdoms-wslpe45-pilot"
python3 -m unittest tests.test_wslpe_management_vmnet_plan -v
sudo python3 scripts/wslpe-management-vmnet-plan.py \
  --vmnet vmnet3 --management-prefix 172.28.232 \
  --workspace-root "$HOME/kingdoms-rebuild/workspace" \
  --workspace-root "$HOME/kingdoms-lpe-standalone/workspace"
```

The CLI also reads all host IPv4 addresses/routes from the existing WSLPE host checker, validates exact unchanged vmnet2 exercise subnet metadata, checks duplicate VMware vmnet keys, inspects all `.vmx` files under the two supplied workspaces for `vmnet3`, records the current `/etc/vmware/networking` SHA256 and prints an **additive proposal** only.

Expected during the currently running NORTH lab: `[DEFERRED] 5 VMware guest process(es) running - DO NOT CHANGE SHARED NETWORKING`, exit 2. This is a successful safety refusal, not permission to shut down these VMs.

If a separate third-party VMware workspace or manually registered/offline VM exists elsewhere, it must be independently inventoried before network allocation. This tool can only prove ownership for explicitly inspected workspace roots.

## Not yet approved

- No `--apply` flag exists and no host services are changed.
- A separate owner-verified transaction, a captured VMware network backup and a scheduled full maintenance window will be needed to allocate vmnet3, because the existing VMware network bootstrap uses shared `vmware-networks --stop/--start` and refuses running VMs.
- Do not manually edit `/etc/vmware/networking`, restart VMware networking with NORTH guests running, or delete WSLPE VM registrations.
- After vmnet creation, independently prove host adapter address persistence across VMware Workstation 26 restarts and isolate vmnet3 from NORTH and vmnet2.
- Only then validate the new disposable guest NIC, Windows management firewall restrictions, direct authenticated WinRM, Vagrant lifecycle and exact removal of that guest's host forwards.

**NORTH integration and WSLPE release to main remain blocked pending runtime acceptance.**
